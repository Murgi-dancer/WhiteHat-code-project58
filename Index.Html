<h1>My name is Anishka Singh, and my favorite hobby is playing basketball!!!!!</h1>
    <div class="class"></div>
          <p>My favorit hobby is Basketball . I can play basketball for 
           hours and hours without getting bored and tired as I enjoy playing 
            it a lot.It is also fun and easy to learn.Playing basketball has a lot of advantages like it improves our balance and coordination,builds endurance,build up muscle,burn calories (an hour of basketball can burn 630â€“750 calories),develop concentration and self-discipline.Besides all this it also helps to increase our 
           height.These skills are shown to have a positive effect on promoting a healthy body weight and encouraging more physical activity, which can enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and self-esteem</p>
